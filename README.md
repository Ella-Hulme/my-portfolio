## Project List

### 1. Permutation Cipher (Java)
A permutation cipher implemented in Java. This project encrypts a message by scrambling the characters in a given pattern and then decrypts the message using a provided key.

- **Features**: 
  - Encrypts and decrypts using a key.
  - Command-line interface for input/output.

- **Technologies**: Java

### 2. Permutation Cipher with Cryptanalysis (Java)
This is an enhanced version of the permutation cipher where the key is unknown during decryption. Instead of using the key directly, it employs cryptanalysis to estimate the key and decrypt the ciphertext.

- **Features**: 
  - Decrypts without knowing the key.
  - Uses cryptanalysis techniques to guess the key.

- **Technologies**: Java

### 3. Vigenère Cipher (Python)
A Python implementation of the Vigenère cipher, a classic method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword.

- **Features**: 
  - Encrypts and decrypts messages using a Vigenère cipher.
  - Command-line interface for input/output.

- **Technologies**: Python

### 4. Vigenère Cipher with Cryptanalysis (Python)
This project decrypts Vigenère cipher text without knowing the key using frequency analysis. 

- **Features**: 
  - Decrypts ciphertext using cryptanalysis.
  - Implements frequency analysis.

- **Technologies**: Python

### 5. Stop-and-Wait Protocol for Reliable Data Transfer (Java)
This project simulates the Stop-and-Wait protocol, a simple data link layer protocol used in reliable data transfer. The implementation demonstrates how data is sent, acknowledged, and retransmitted in case of packet loss.

- **Features**: 
  - Sender and receiver simulate the reliable transmission of data packets.
  - Handles packet loss and retransmission.

- **Technologies**: Java

### 6. Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement (Java)
This project simulates the Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol between four participants. It demonstrates how secure keys can be exchanged over an insecure channel using this classic cryptographic technique.

- **Features**: 
  - Simulates key agreement between four different parties.
  - Uses modular exponentiation to securely exchange keys.

- **Technologies**: Java

### 7. Password Manager (Python)
A simple Python password manager that allows users to securely store and retrieve their passwords.

- **Features**: 
  - Stores and retrieves encrypted passwords.
  - Simple command-line interface for managing accounts.

- **Technologies**: Python
